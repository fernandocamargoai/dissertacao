\begin{abstract}FFor countries like Brazil, which has hybrid resources as the major source of electricity, the optimization of the operation of the hydroelectric plants is extremely important and it's being studied recurrently. This problem has been formulated through optimization and simulation models. This article adresses the theme using a known model of optimization, while it applies two groups of multiobjective optimization algorithms in order to compare them and conclude which one is the best to solve the problem. They are the Evolutionary Algorithms: NSGA-II, SPEA2 and MOCell; and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms: OMOPSO and SMPSO.\end{abstract}
